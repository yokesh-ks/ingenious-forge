This page provides a high-level overview of guidelines for contributing to OpenClaw, the repository organization, and typical development workflows. OpenClaw is structured as a multi-platform TypeScript monorepo leveraging modern tooling and strict architectural boundaries to facilitate scalable, maintainable, and extensible development.

---

## Contributing

OpenClaw employs a collaborative model welcoming contributions such as bug fixes and improvements following established workflows and guidelines defined in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

Key points to note:

- **Pull Request Workflow:** All PRs must include concrete validation evidence [AGENTS.md:16](). Maintainers use a specialized `scripts/pr` wrapper to manage the lifecycle of PRs, ensuring code trust boundaries are respected [scripts/pr:12-14]().
- **Code Ownership:** `CODEOWNERS` routes reviewers but does not itself enforce approval; maintainers must verify live branch protection rules [AGENTS.md:19]().
- **Real Behavior Proof:** OpenClaw mandates that verdicts need source, tests, and dependency contract proof; diff-only reviews are insufficient [AGENTS.md:12]().
- **Repair Doctrine:** The repository follows a strict "Repair Doctrine" where root-cause investigation is the default. Refactors that leave code better than it was found are preferred over narrow workarounds [AGENTS.md:24-34]().
- **Codex Hard Gate:** For any behavior involving the Codex runtime, acting agents must personally inspect the sibling `../codex` source for exact protocol behavior before rendering a verdict or code change [AGENTS.md:14]().
- **CI/CD Guards:** The system uses `scripts/pr-lib/clawsweeper-review-gate.mjs` to validate maintainer review comments and head SHAs before landing [scripts/pr-lib/merge.sh:92-112]().

For in-depth contribution instructions, PR processes, labeling system, and code review practices, see the **[Contributing](#9.1)** subpage.

## Project Structure

OpenClaw is architected as a monorepo supporting integrated development and clear separation of concerns across multiple platforms.

### Core Repository Layout

| Directory | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `src/` | Core TypeScript source: agents, gateway, and runtime logic. |
| `extensions/` | Internal plugin packages (referred to as "plugins" in UI/Docs) [AGENTS.md:20](). |
| `apps/` | Platform-specific native client apps (iOS, macOS, Android, Linux) [AGENTS.md:21](). |
| `scripts/` | Local tooling, PR wrappers, and generated-artifact helpers [scripts/AGENTS.md:3](). |
| `skills/` | Bundled skill library including `SKILL.md` definitions [.agents/skills/openclaw-pr-maintainer/SKILL.md:3-9](). |
| `qa/` | Scenario pack assets and repository-backed QA resources. |
| `.agents/` | Specialized agent skills for repository maintenance (e.g., `openclaw-pr-maintainer`) [.agents/skills/openclaw-pr-maintainer/SKILL.md:1-5](). |
| `.local/` | Reserved namespace for ephemeral artifacts, transition journals, and merge audits [scripts/pr-lib/worktree.sh:78-79](). |

### Monorepo Management Highlights

- **pnpm Workspaces:** The repository uses `pnpm` for dependency management. If pnpm would reconcile a shared install during execution, developers are encouraged to use `node scripts/run-vitest.mjs` to bypass preflights [.agents/skills/openclaw-testing/SKILL.md:124-126]().
- **Wrapper Trust Boundary:** The `scripts/pr` script classifies subcommands into `advisory` (can run local code) and `landing` (requires origin-main code) to maintain security during the merge process [scripts/pr:17-28]().
- **Pathfinder Rule:** Touched code must be left better than found; unrelated issues discovered mid-task should be fixed if small or recorded as follow-ups [AGENTS.md:34]().

For a full explanation of repository layout, package organization, and monorepo management conventions, please see **[Project Structure](#9.2)**.

## Development Workflow

OpenClaw emphasizes an efficient developer experience, utilizing scoped testing, remote execution for heavy suites, and automated release gates.

### Typical Local Development Cycle

1.  **Hydration:** Run `pnpm install` to resolve workspace dependencies. If it fails, report the first actionable error [AGENTS.md:18]().
2.  **Testing:** Use `scripts/run-vitest.mjs` for local test execution [scripts/AGENTS.md:8](). Confirmed bugs require a failing reproduction before editing [AGENTS.md:38]().
3.  **PR Preparation:** Use `scripts/pr review-init` and `prepare-gates` to validate changes against the required test plan [scripts/pr:23]().
4.  **Remote Proof:** For heavy suites or untrusted fork code, use `crabbox` backends (AWS or Blacksmith Testbox) to run tests in isolated environments [.agents/skills/openclaw-testing/SKILL.md:27-30]().
5.  **Merge Verification:** The `merge-run` command performs a final verification, including a `merge-crabbox-parent-audit` to detect intervening main movement [scripts/pr-lib/merge.sh:29-85]().
