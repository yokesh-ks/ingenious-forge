This page documents OpenClaw's multi-platform build system, continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) infrastructure, and release processes. It offers a high-level perspective on building TypeScript into distributable JavaScript, producing native iOS/macOS/Android/Linux apps, validating builds through CI pipelines, and publishing releases to npm, Docker registries, and app distribution platforms.

For development workflows and local environment setup, refer to [Development Workflow](#9.3).

---

## Purpose and Scope

OpenClaw builds and releases software artifacts across multiple platforms and channels to support diverse deployment targets and end-user environments:

- **Node.js package** (`openclaw` on npm): Contains the CLI and Gateway server runtime [[package.json:22-24]]().
- **Docker images** on GitHub Container Registry (GHCR): For server deployments with multi-architecture support (amd64, arm64) [[test/scripts/package-acceptance-workflow.test.ts:38-39]]().
- **macOS app**: Menubar application featuring Sparkle-based auto-update functionality [[.github/workflows/ci.yml:110-110]]().
- **iOS/watchOS apps**: Native mobile and wearable clients [[.github/workflows/ci.yml:58-62]]().
- **Android app**: Native Android client delivered via APK/AAB [[.github/workflows/ci.yml:111-111]]().
- **Linux app**: Tauri-based companion app with system tray and canvas support [[test/scripts/package-acceptance-workflow.test.ts:36-37]]().

The build system fulfills key roles:
1. Compile TypeScript source into optimized JavaScript bundles for Node.js and Docker runtimes using `tsdown` [[package.json:68-68]]().
2. Generate native app binaries for iOS/macOS (Swift/Xcode-based) and Android (Kotlin/Gradle-based) [[.github/workflows/ci.yml:110-111]]().
3. Validate build and release artifacts before publication using comprehensive smoke tests [[.github/workflows/openclaw-release-checks.yml:1-3]]().
4. Support incremental CI builds with intelligent code scope detection to reduce cycle times via `preflight` [[.github/workflows/ci.yml:88-125]]().

---

## 8.1 Multi-Platform Build System

OpenClaw utilizes tailored build toolchains per platform, all coordinated under a pnpm workspace. The Node.js build is orchestrated by `tsdown`, while native platforms utilize their respective ecosystem tools. `XcodeGen` is used to manage iOS/macOS project structures [[scripts/ci-changed-scope.mjs:58-62]](), and `Gradle` handles Android compilation [[test/scripts/ci-workflow-guards.test.ts:57-57]](). For Linux, Tauri and Cargo manage the Rust-based backend and frontend bundling. Dependency hygiene is enforced across the monorepo using `knip` [[docs/ci.md:47-47]]().

## 8.2 CI/CD Pipeline

OpenClaw leverages GitHub Actions workflows integrated with custom scripts to maintain code quality and release readiness.

### Workflow Structure
- **Admission & Concurrency**: A concurrency group logic for canonical `main` pushes to allow two non-canceling slots [[.github/workflows/ci.yml:70-74]]().
- **Preflight**: Detects changed scopes (e.g., `run_android`, `run_macos`, `run_node`) via `scripts/ci-changed-scope.mjs` to skip unnecessary jobs [[scripts/ci-changed-scope.mjs:9-41]]().
- **Security & Quality**: Includes `CodeQL` critical quality gates, private key detection via `trufflehog` [[test/scripts/ci-workflow-guards.test.ts:68-68]](), and changed-workflow audit via `zizmor` [[docs/ci.md:37-37]]().
- **Locale Refresh**: Automated workflows for refreshing native app and Control UI translations [[test/scripts/ci-workflow-guards.test.ts:72-73]]().

**High-Level CI/CD Pipeline**

graph TB
    subgraph "Preflight_Phase" ["Preflight (ci.yml)"]
        Scope["preflight (Scope Detection)"]
    end

        LiveChecks["openclaw-live-and-e2e-checks-reusable.yml"]

For detailed CI/CD documentation, see [CI/CD Pipeline](#8.2).

---

## 8.3 Release Process

OpenClaw follows a disciplined versioning and multi-channel publication process based on Calendar Versioning (CalVer).

### Versioning & Promotion
Releases conform to CalVer in `YYYY.M.D` format [[package.json:3-3]]().
1. **Release Branching**: Work happens on `main` or specific release-candidate refs [[.github/workflows/ci.yml:47-51]]().
2. **Validation**: The `Full Release Validation` workflow must be green for the exact candidate SHA [[.github/workflows/full-release-validation.yml:1-10]]().
3. **Publication**: `openclaw-release-publish.yml` handles npm publication and coordinates multi-platform releases [[test/scripts/package-acceptance-workflow.test.ts:54-54]]().

For detailed release documentation, see [Release Process](#8.3).

---

## 8.4 Testing Strategy

OpenClaw employs comprehensive testing layers emphasizing correctness and upgrade safety.

- **Unit & Integration**: Powered by Vitest, sharded by `scripts/lib/ci-node-test-plan.mts` for optimized execution [[scripts/lib/ci-node-test-plan.mts:1-10]]().
- **Test Sharding**: Shard planning handles core, plugin, and channel contracts separately [[.github/workflows/ci.yml:124-125]]().
- **E2E Smoke Tests**: Validates behavior across OS environments using `openclaw-live-and-e2e-checks-reusable.yml` [[test/scripts/package-acceptance-workflow.test.ts:34-34]]().
- **Upgrade Path**: Specifically tests migration safety using `upgrade-survivor` logic [[.github/workflows/full-release-validation.mts:57-58]]().

For comprehensive testing details, see [Testing Strategy](#8.4).

---

## 8.5 QA Lab & Scenario Packs

The QA Lab provides high-fidelity validation using real-world scenarios and messaging platforms.

- **Scenario Packs**: Structured test assets under `./qa` including manual and executable suites [[test/scripts/ci-workflow-guards.test.ts:97-101]]().
- **QA Live Matrix**: Validates transports like Telegram, Discord, and Slack against live provider backends [[.github/workflows/openclaw-release-checks.yml:106-108]]().
- **Live Credential Leasing**: Uses a `Convex` credential broker to manage shared secrets during parallel runs [[test/scripts/package-acceptance-workflow.test.ts:156-156]]().
- **Plugin Prerelease**: Dedicated validation for ClawHub and npm plugin publication [[test/scripts/package-acceptance-workflow.test.ts:55-59]]().
