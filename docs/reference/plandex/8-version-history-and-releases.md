This page documents the release history and version information for Plandex, covering both the CLI and server components. It provides a chronological overview of major releases, key features introduced in each version, and notable bug fixes. For more detailed information about specific CLI and server releases, see [CLI Releases](#7.1) and [Server Releases](#7.2).

## Versioning Overview

Plandex uses semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH) for both CLI and server components, with occasional build/hotfix indicators (like "+1"). The CLI and server components are versioned separately but typically align closely in their major and minor versions.

### Current Versions

| Component | Current Version | Release Date |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| CLI       | 2.1.6+1        | Latest       |
| Server    | 2.1.8          | Latest       |

## Version 2.x Series (Current)

The 2.x series represents a major evolution of Plandex, with significant architectural improvements and new capabilities.

### Version 2.0.0 (Major Release)

Released as a beta version, 2.0.0 was described as a "new project with far more ambitious goals" rather than a simple update to 1.x. It included:

- **Architecture**: Complete redesign with a multi-model approach combining models from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google
- **Developer Experience**: New REPL interface with fuzzy autocomplete and multi-line editing
- **Context Management**: Automatic context selection with tree-sitter project maps supporting 30+ languages
- **File Editing**: Improved reliability for large files up to 100k tokens
- **Automation**: Configurable levels from basic to full auto with command execution integration
- **Licensing**: Transition from AGPL 3.0 to MIT License

  - GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1-mini, and GPT-4.1-nano replacing GPT-4o models
- **Enhanced Fallback System**: Robust fallback and retry system for newly released models and preview models
- **Gemini Caching**: Prompt caching support for Gemini models, reducing costs and latency
- **REPL Improvements**: Better handling of mistyped commands and suggestions

#### Version 2.1.5-2.1.6+1

Recent releases focus on cutting-edge model integration:

- **Claude Sonnet 4**: Added as built-in model, promoted to default in daily-driver pack (2.1.6)
- **Claude Opus 4**: Available in new `strong-opus` and `opus-planner` model packs
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Additional retries for unresponsive models and provider rate limits
- **Error Handling**: Fixes for garbled error messages and lock acquisition issues

Sources: [releases/cli/CHANGELOG.md:1-103](), [releases/server/CHANGELOG.md:1-37]()

### Version 2.0.5 - 2.0.7

These releases focused on stability, reliability and user experience improvements:

- Error handling and model error messaging improvements
- Better handling of partial or mistyped commands in the REPL
- Consolidated Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental into a single model pack
- Fixed whitespace handling and prevent '\send' command inclusion in multi-line mode

## Upgrade Notes

Upgrading between minor versions within the same major version is generally straightforward. However, upgrading between major versions (e.g., 1.x to 2.x) may require additional steps:

- **1.x to 2.x**: Version 2.x is designed to run separately and independently from v1. Follow the quickstart guide as if you were a new user rather than upgrading in-place.
- **Cloud Users**: The Plandex Cloud service is automatically updated to the latest version.
- **Self-hosted Users**: Refer to the deployment documentation for instructions on upgrading self-hosted instances.
