The **API Layer & Host-Client Bridge** constitutes the central infrastructure enabling communication between the Node.js Host environment and the browser Client UI in DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`). It exposes services on the Host as secure, typed remote procedure calls (RPCs) and multiplexed streaming endpoints consumable by the browser client through HTTP and WebSocket protocols.

This layer abstracts:
- Carrier-neutral RPC transport.
- Authentication and trust enforcement using signed browser cookies and strict Host/Origin validation [packages/api/gateway/README.md:31-33]().
- Multiplexed logical streams over WebSockets with reconnect and backoff managed by `ConnectionController` [packages/client/connection/src/client/connection.ts:77-111]().
- Type-safe remote invocation built on the Typert system with generated contracts [packages/api/gateway/src/client/index.ts:103-132]().

This page provides a high-level overview of the main components and their integration. Detailed technical documentation is available in dedicated child pages for each major subsystem:

## 5.1 API Proxy & RPC Protocol

The **API Proxy & RPC Protocol** forms the transport and gateway abstraction exposed to browser clients. This subsystem manages connection generations, request authentication, and HTTP/WebSocket bridging between the browser and Node.js Host.

The `ConnectionController` orchestrates connection generations, state transitions, and exponential backoff recovery [packages/client/connection/src/client/connection.ts:77-111](). On the Host side, `TypertGatewayService` and `RemoteStreamMuxServer` handle incoming RPC requests, schema validation, and multiplexed streaming over WebSockets [packages/api/gateway/src/index.ts:1-70](), [packages/api/gateway/src/stream-server.ts:55-114]().

For in-depth protocol details including SSE streaming, request trust validation, retry policy, and fetch handler internals, see [API Proxy & RPC Protocol](#5.1).

## 5.2 Typert: Type-Safe RPC Generation

The **Typert** subsystem enables end-to-end type safety for remote procedure calls between Host and Client using generated code declarations. Host services extend `TypertRemoteService` and annotate methods with `@Remote` or `@RemoteScope` decorators [packages/api/gateway/README.md:27-29]().

Invocation descriptors generated during the build pipeline provide strict runtime validation on the Host and expose type-safe contracts on the Client via `ClientRemote` [packages/api/gateway/src/client/index.ts:103-132](). Unary results and streams are validated through codecs before crossing the transport boundary.

For full technical details on decorators, type analysis, build pipeline, and generated contracts, see [Typert: Type-Safe RPC Generation](#5.2).

## 5.3 Client Runtime & Session Management

On the browser side, the **Client Runtime** provides the `ClientRemoteService` registered as `ctx.remote` in the Cordis dependency injection container [packages/api/gateway/src/client/index.ts:127-143](). It unifies multiplexed stream handling via `RemoteStreamMuxClient` and manages physical transport recovery with `ConnectionController`.

The client runtime mediates session lifecycles, conversation node assembly, workspace routing, and stream dispatch while supporting cooperative cancellation through `AbortSignal` parameters [packages/api/gateway/src/client/index.ts:145-201]().

For thorough coverage of session management, multiplexed dispatch, history paging, and runtime extensibility, see [Client Runtime & Session Management](#5.3).

# Summary

The **API Layer & Host-Client Bridge** orchestrates the exposure of Node.js Host services as type-safe, authenticated RPC endpoints for consumption by the browser client.

Key constituents are:
- **Connection Management**: Carrier-neutral HTTP and WebSocket bridge equipped with browser authentication and retry-aware connection generation [packages/client/connection/src/client/connection.ts:77-111]().
- **Typert Gateway Service**: Hosts typed invocation dispatch and Remote streaming protocol atop the connection layer [packages/api/gateway/src/index.ts:1-70]().
- **Client Runtime**: Implements browser client proxies for typed Remote method calls and multiplexed streams integrated into Cordis service contexts [packages/api/gateway/src/client/index.ts:127-143]().
